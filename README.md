#Workflow Summary
The purpose of the workflow is to allow retail members to release a stop payment that has been placed on a customer account and document the process in Synergy. 

The user will be prompted to enter the customer account number and details of the stop payment that is being removed. After the stop payment info is entered, a list of stops that meet the criteria will be given to the user to select from. If the item they are attempting to remove is present on the accounts non-post; a review activity will be sent to Deposit Services to approve or deny the removal of the stop payment. Once the release of stop payment is approved, it will be removed from the customer account and an audit trail document will be filed to synergy.
